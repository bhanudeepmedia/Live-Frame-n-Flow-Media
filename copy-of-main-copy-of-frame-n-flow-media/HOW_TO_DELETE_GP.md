## 🔍 **CAN'T FIND THE DELETE BUTTON?**

### Check these things:
1. ✅ Are you logged in as **admin**? (Not as a growth partner)
2. ✅ Are you on the **"Partners"** tab? (Not "Applications" or other tabs)
3. ✅ Is your screen wide enough? (On mobile, you might need to scroll right)
4. ✅ Look for the **trash icon (🗑️)** - it's red and on the right side

### If you still can't see it:
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear your browser cache
- Try a different browser
- Make sure you're using the latest version of the code

---

## 📱 **ON MOBILE:**

The delete button is still there, but you might need to:
1. Scroll the table horizontally (swipe left)
2. Or use the "View Profile" method instead
3. The delete button is at the bottom of the profile modal

---

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**

🔴 **Deletion is PERMANENT** - there's no undo button!

🔴 **All data is removed** - logs, earnings, leads, everything!

🔴 **Download backup first** - you'll be glad you did!

🔴 **Triple-check** - make sure you're deleting the right person!

---

## 🎯 **SUMMARY:**

**Where to delete GPs:**
1. **Partners tab → Trash icon (🗑️)** on the right of each row
2. **Partners tab → View Profile → Delete Partner button** at bottom

**Both methods work the same way!**

Choose whichever is easier for you. The trash icon in the table is usually faster! 🚀
